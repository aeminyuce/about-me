INSERT INTO "lab"."intro" ("id", "title", "subtitle", "leadtext", "textpart1", "textpart2", "textpart3") VALUES ('1', 'Hi! I am building modular design systems for you.', 'For developing web interfaces fastly!', 'I build fast, scalable, and fully modular front‑end systems designed from the ground up for each project. Instead of relying on third‑party CSS frameworks or JavaScript plugins, I craft every component myself—from grid layouts and UI patterns like buttons, accordions, dialogs, and interactive galleries.', 'This approach gives me complete control over performance, accessibility, and design consistency, allowing me to deliver interfaces that feel cohesive, lightweight, and uniquely tailored.', 'My focus is on creating custom design systems that empower clients with a visual language and component library built exclusively for their brand. Using Less, vanilla JavaScript, and handcrafted React components, I develop flexible modules that can evolve with the product.', 'The result is a clean, maintainable foundation that accelerates development while preserving creative freedom—perfect for teams who value both speed and originality.');
